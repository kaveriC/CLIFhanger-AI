# CLIFhanger-AI

CLIFhanger-AI is an open-source application designed to facilitate natural language querying the CLIF relational database at a site. This README provides an overview of the project's broad plan and key features.

## Project Overview

CLIFhanger-AI aims to create a user-friendly interface for querying the CLIF relational database at a site using natural language processing. The application is designed to be deployed locally at each CLIF consortium site, ensuring data privacy and compliance with PHI regulations.

## Key Features

1. **Open Source Technologies**: Utilizes PostgreSQL, Docker, Python, and open-source language models like GPT-J or LLaMA 2.
2. **Local Database Setup**: Each site manages its own data (30-100 GB) on local servers.
3. **GitHub Distribution**: Easily shareable database schema, ETL scripts, and application code via GitHub.
4. **PostgreSQL Database**: Robust, extensible, and community-supported database system.
5. **Docker Containerization**: Ensures consistency and ease of deployment across different environments.
6. **Open-Source LLM Integration**: Allows natural language queries to be translated into SQL without manual coding.
7. **Large Data Volume Management**: Strategies for handling substantial datasets efficiently.
8. **Security Focused**: Implements best practices for data protection and user authentication.
9. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Includes detailed setup instructions and user guides.
10. **Open-Source Licensing**: Ensures compliance and encourages community contributions.

## Broad Implementation Plan

1. Set up PostgreSQL database with optimized schema for medical data.
2. Develop ETL scripts for data loading and transformation.
3. Containerize the application using Docker for easy deployment.
4. Integrate an open-source LLM (GPT-J or LLaMA 2) for natural language processing.
5. Create a user-friendly interface for query input and result display.
6. Implement security measures including authentication and data validation.
7. Prepare comprehensive documentation for setup and usage.
8. Choose appropriate open-source licenses for code and documentation.
